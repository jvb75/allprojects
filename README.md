## Web-based Project for Cleaning Company
The objective is to demonstrate how the MVC technique can be applied in PHP. This web-based project harnesses the power of PHP, MySQL, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML to create an elegant solution for a small-scale cleaning service. At its core, the project embraces the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, a sophisticated software design pattern renowned for its effectiveness in crafting intuitive user interfaces. This architectural approach elegantly separates the complexities of program logic into three interrelated components: the model, which handles the data and business logic; the view, which presents the user's interface; and the controller, which orchestrates interactions between the model and the view.

The primary goal of this endeavor is to showcase the seamless application of the MVC technique within PHP, illustrating how it can streamline development and enhance user experience.
